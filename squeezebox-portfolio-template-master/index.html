			<h2>Connect Four</h2>
			<em>One of my first neat programming projects.</em>
			<p>
				This project is one of my fondest memories, partly because of the fact that it was one of the first examples of programming in which I actually got to interact with something interesting. Let alone a classic game! 
                
                <br><br>
                
                The logic for this little console interface python game is visualizing and constructing the game board as a two dimension array. Once that was done, it was a matter of taking all of the basic rules into account, and defining the logic so that win conditions could end the game as intended and that a "prettier" version of the game board could be printed out to the players. 

                This project was completed during my first year of programming, so it's not the most sofisticated, but it holds a soft spot in my heart!

			<h2>My first real challenge </h2>
			<em>Oh othello, how you put me down. But rise again I did!</em>
			<p>
                If I'm going to be honest. I failed this project the first time around. But that isnt to say that my work was without merit. I learned possibly the most important thing that most software engineers or CS students tend to dread like boogeyman himself. Failure and its inevitability. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I took the class that this project was featured in, in the winter quarter of my freshman year. Mind you, I was an eager freshman with absolutely zero programming expereince prior to arriving at UC Irvine. All I knew was that I loved technology and was dead set on pursuing a career that allowed me to aid in its creation and innovation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This project and class as a whole however, was wakeup call to what software engineering would hold in store for me. Up until this point, my programming was making simple functions and a console based connnect four game. This was my first GUI, the first piece of code that I could click, see color, and interact with the way I interact with any other program on my computer.
			</p>
            <p>
                The process that was needed to  make this a reality was a little hard for me to grasp at first, and the impending time crunch at hand gave my first dose of working on something I didnt necessarily know if I could finish, espcially on time. Alas the due date came and what was turned in, was an incomplete project that made me feel so inadequate. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Although I was not the only one to have struggled with the class, the overarching atmosphere didnt seem to make me feel better. Among my classmates there was talks of switching majors, doubt about their inability to pursue such a daunting career. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As I write this, I close towards my final year as a computer science undergraduate. Meaning, (thank goodness), that I did not waiver. I realized that accepting failure was a part of the game, and that my professors instance that many of us give up and switch out was an attempt to thin the herd so to speak. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Well I didn't buy it, I acknowledged the fact that some people are naturally good at programming and computer science, but that didnt meant that I couldn't be as well. I knew that would have to work twice as long or hard for the same result that somebody else could have hashed out in no time. But one thing that would give me the advantage, was the fact that I would have experience dealing with pressure and stress. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I would have to retake this class as well as another. The summer break of my Junior year into my Senior year would end up being my first and only realy break of college as a I spent my summers either retaking or taking other classes in advance, in order to ensure a timely graduation. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Looking back this project might not be the most complex, but it certainly had a big impact on my journey as an aspiring software engineer.

            <h2>What's an API? </h2>
			<em>My first introduction to the wonderful world of APi's.</em>
			<p>
				This project is another fond memory of mine, especially because of the fact that I was made aware of one of the greatest tools for building neat stuff; The API (Application Programming Interface).
			</p>
			<p>
				At first, when my professor had informed us that we were to build was is essentially a GPS system, I was very curious as too what my professor had up his sleeve. 
                Low and behold, the API.
			</p>
			<p>
				It seemed too good to be true. So you're telling me, that companies build specialized pieces of software, so that we can build cool stuff using their services? Sure, you have to obey certain licensing agreements, but yes its true! 
			</p>
                
            <p>
                After skimming the Mapquest Python API learning about Json and how to parse it for information, we were easily able to make a fun little python GPS directions system. The system was even able to tell use information like latitude longitude and even drive time!

			<h2>C++!?</h2>
			<em>I have to do what with my variables??.</em>
			<p>
				This project is a special one in that it was one of my first real dabbles with C++, a language known for being a "real" programming language compared to something like python.
			</p>
			<p>
				Having to name the data type of all my variables was a little weird at first, but to be honest as I've progressed along my career, I have defintely come to appreciate knowing what exactly I am dealing with at all times.
			</p>
			<p>
				The logic itself is based on the creation on a coin class , with the highlight of the program being a greedy algorithm that calculates change for transactions by going down the line of coins from largest amount to smallest amount per coin, choosing the optimum number of coins for change..

			<h2>Databases, and what lies under the hood</h2>
			<em>select blank from blank.</em>
			<p>
				A database, by definition it is a structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways. My classmates and I knew what a database was in this sense, but up until this class, we had no experience with how we would interact with one in the practical sense.
			</p>
                 
			<p>
                Enter CS122A: Introduction to databases. I loved this class, in large part due to the fact that my professor structured the class in which we would go through our curriculum as we strove to lay the groundwork for a fake company called Topical Birds.
			</p>
            
			<p>
				When one thinks about databases without having any experience with it, all one usually thinks is a basic excel sheet where data is entered. Throughout this course my mind was opened up to the intracacies involving MySQL databases, including data models, relational vs non-relational databases, schemas, concurrency ,normalization, queries, stored procedures, and the list goes on.
                Here youll find some of my work from the class!

			<h2>Imaaggination!</h2>

			<p>
				This was one of the first assignments given to me in my ISC53 class. The objective of this project was to brush up on our C++ in a fun way!

			<p>
				The main goal of the program was to be able to open and load any dungeon file that was provided to us in the form of a specifically formatted text file, and correctly traverse the area. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The way I achieved this was by opening and parsing the file, and partitioned all of the rooms and their associated information into instances of room structs that I created.

				In order to achieve this, I created a heap of 128 bytes and assured that each new piece of data allocated to that heap would have two bytes of header information infront of it. The most significat byte of the header data would be set as the block number, the least significant byte would be set to the block size and the least significant bit would be set to the allocation status.

				This project was a cool little way of showcasing one of the most imporant and widely used models for computer programs; the client - server model. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In this project, the main task at hand was to create working client and server programs that would communicate over the internet via the socket python library.
			</p>
			<p>
				The client, would contact the server, send the server a persons name and await the servers request.The server, once started, would wait to recieve a connection and name and would send the client the persons email if the person happened to be in its email database.The server would also continously run until its process is killed.

			<h2>From Classroom To The Field</h2>
			<em>My First Internship!</em>
			<p>
				At Metronome Software LLC,  I worked as software engineering intern from June 2016, to September 2016. While on the metronome team, I had the opportunity to work on two Projects, ECLOAK and NIDUS.  ECLOAK is a “”. 
			</p>
			<p>
				NIDUS is a “on internet or secure hypervisor with nested virtualization based on cloudstack”. On the Cloak project, I worked as a backend engineer and was tasked mainly with working with the design team in order to implement a revitalized version of the projects Mobile-GUI as well as implemented the functionality to the designs.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a result I learned to use the Android development environment , the Java programming language, the XML modeling language for implementing graphical interfaces and dealt with sending, retrieving and displaying pertinent information from the ECLOAK services servers by integrating specialized http requests and modified Cursor adapters into the mobile apps backend. 
			</p>
            
            <p>
                My work on Ecloak includes revised versions of the main dashboard and other pages. On Nidus I was also tasked implementing functional implementations of the design teams app mockups. As a result I ended up Implementing the new login page both graphically on the front end of the app and in the backend by using specialized http posts while handling authentication.  I was also tasked with implementing the main functionality of the app involving creating and sending modular REST API commands to the cloudstack server/ NIDUS service. 
            </p>
            <p>
                On the professional side of things, I learned how to function as part of a software engineering team. This included communicating with the design team to clear up or clarify any discrepancies of questions regarding the projects looks and functionality, communicating with other backend engineers in order to ensure cohesive programming practices and where the project was heading as a whole, and communicating with Project Leads in order to provide project updates, carry out any specific tasks needed of me, and to bring up important questions involving the projects workflow, functionality and possible future improvements.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a software engineer at Metronome I also learned how to work under the Scrum Agile programming software development model. This included working on tickets according to whatever was in the current scrum sprint. Ticketing and other necessary information was accessed using the Atlasssian Jira and Confluence software. Mercurial, conflict resolution with meld (merge tool), advanced repository stuff. atlassian stuff is process management. LINUX: grep, search, shell/bash stuff, sshing. Giving daily updates.

			<h2>My First Website!</h2>
			<em>dabbling with web dev over summer!</em>
			<p>
				As you might be guessing from the title, this is the first website I've ever built! I've always wanted to build my website and this summer, the summer before my last summer of college, was the perfect time to do so! 
			</p>
            
			<p>
				Even though I was not able to land another software engineering internship this summer, I was determined to not let this summer go to waste. So my first thought regarding what side projects I should start was the portfolio website
			</p>
            
			<p>
				The process for starting and building this website has been unbelievably fun and rewarding. For learning HTML I ran through Code Academy's tutorial course and also used the development tools in my browser to look at the source HTML files for websites that I tend to frequent. I also managed to learn more about CSS and Javascript through W3schools.com and edited some of their CSS templates to use in my website!

			<h2>Fear the wumpus!</h2>
			<em>My first foray into the world of artificial intelligence</em>
			<p>
				This assignment was felt rather daunting at first, but ended up being one of the more enjoyable projects that I've worked on. 
			</p>
			
			
            <p>
                The name of the game is Wumpus, the objective of this game is have our hero traverse a map of rooms separated by doors so that he/she can retrieve a chest full of treasure. The map however is not devoid of obstacles and dangers. Somewhere in the map lies the monster known as the wumpus, as well as a multitude of bottomless pits, and if our hero were to have the misfortune of stepping into one of these rooms, our hero perishes. The one tool our hero has to aid them in their journey is their senses, if the wumpus is in any of the adjacent rooms, the hero will percieve a stench and a breeze in the case of nearby pits.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The way I went about creating survival heuristics was probably the most enjoyable part of the project. I walked through a visual representation of the wumpus map, and put my theoretical character through a number of different scenarios in order to see if there was any discernable pattern that I could percieve. What I ended up noticing was that having the character move around the map in a snake like fashion while taking note of various percepts in the environment gave the character a siginifcantly high chance of finding the gold. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if the hero perceives a stench in the beginning tile, it can only go one of two ways, each with a 50% chance of meeting their doom. In the case where the hero survives this first obstacle, the hero can then commence its snake routine. What this does is that while snaking around map and taking note of perceived smells, the hero can then make educated guesses about where these dangers actually are and avoid the suspected tiles. Once the hero has found the gold, or has run out of safe tiles to explore (in the case that the gold has been spawned with the wumpus or inside of a pit), then the hero can merely backtrack on its noted safe tiles and exit the map safely.

			<h2>Embedded Systems</h2>
			<em>One of my absolute favorite classes at UCI</em>
			<p>
				As part of my embedded systems class at UCI, we were tasked with building multiple projects over the course of 10 weeks, of which I will telling you all about my favorite, the music maker. The body of this project is comprised of a 9v power battery for power, the atmel atmega32 chip, an LCD, a keypad for input and a speaker for output. 
			</p>
            
			<p>
				 One of my goals of this project was to speed up song creation so that I could play around and load different songs into it faster. To do this, instead of creating songs as a collection of frequencies and durations, I mapped two octaves worth of frequencies to their corresponding alphabetical representations and durations to their corresponding musical terms.
