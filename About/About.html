        <p class="white_text">I am recent graduate in Computer Science  from  the University of California Irvine. ,  I am also an active member of the UC Irvine Chapter of Triangle Fraternity, and have also had the honor of serving a term as its New Membership Education Director. My technical experience involves programming in  various languages (Python, C++ , C , HTML, CSS and Java) as well as hands on experience involving Android, IOS and Web development. </p>
        
        
        
        <p class = "white_text"> I wish to pursue a career in software development as it allows me to express and refine my creativity, critical thinking skills and most importantly, help create products or services that will be used by real people for real world needs/problems.
        I also admire and understand the importance of teamwork and collaboration as it allows projects to flourish under the guidance of multiple minds with great ideas, different perspectives, a constant drive to build one anothers skills and hope to be able to contribute to society in such a manner/environment</p>
        
        <p class="white_text">Field experience includes two stints as a software engineering shadow at SendGrid and Panasonic Avionics Corporation and an internship as a software engineer at Metrnome Software LLC. At SendGrid I was introduced to the importance of email and other services that seem to have nothing left to offer by the general public. I learned that nothing is perfect, and that if we look at everything around us with the intent of constant improvement, great things can be accomplished. At Panasonic, I learned how to important the concept of testing is in regards to mobilizing large scale products as intended in the projects mission statement. At Metronome Software, I learned the immeasurable importance of teamwork, communication, and diving into learning new technoloigies despite fear of inadequacy. I had no experience with Android development, Java, XML, Merucrial and or any of the technologies that I came to utilize during my tenure at Metronome. However, I did express my resolve to learn everything I needed to know and execute on the fly. In the end, I would end up contributing a vast amount of work on an software tool that would come to be used by the United States Military.</p>
